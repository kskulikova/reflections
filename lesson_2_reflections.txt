What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The insides of your chosen folder are identified;
To track changes in the component files and status of those changes (were there any commits, etc.) 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a "hub" where all the changes to be commited are stored. It is connected with the repository which is contained within the working directory.
It sort of accumulates changes to be "transferred" to Git.
