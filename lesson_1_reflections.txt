How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It saved me a ton of time searching through all the lines of code!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By enabling you to come back to the earlier versions should you later see other ways of building on the code that's there
or something, or nothing.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: getting logically complete versions
Cons: human error
Pros:good idea in case of any technical problems-won't lose your data
Cons: may end up with too many/few versions that are logically incomplete

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Could be because of the different nature of tasks those systems are working with - for Google Docs, for example,
it's not that important to keep up the interconnectedness of different files 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Being able to restore the previous commits using git check out + comparing the different commits to find what exactly and when caused trouble
